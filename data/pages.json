However, business income is highly susceptible to the ebb and flow of the economy. While income climbed from $1.2 trillion in 2002 to over $3 trillion in 2005 and 2006, it was halved to $1.5 trillion in 2009. From there, it bounced back slightly, reaching over $2 trillion in 2011.",

The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered top tax rates on individuals from 50 percent to 28 percent, made it much more attractive for businesses to pay taxes as pass-throughs rather than as C corporations.",
